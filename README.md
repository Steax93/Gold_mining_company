# Gold_mining_company
Another one of my projects is from the Machine Learning field. 
Here my task was to prepare a prototype of a machine-learning model for Zyfra. The company develops efficiency solutions for heavy industry.
The model should predict the amount of gold recovered from gold ore. You have the data on extraction and purification.
The model will help to optimize production and eliminate unprofitable parameters.
